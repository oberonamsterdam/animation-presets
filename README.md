# React animation presets
Welcome to the React animation presets project. This project will give an overview of reusable animations used within react projects.

## Motivation
The reason this package was created is because there are alot of animations that can be reused. So it would be meaningless to re√Ønvent the wheel everytime we want to create a default page transition or a button hover. This package will help developers to create those kind of animations quicker and easier.

More animations will be added to this package (checkout the [animation roadmap](animationRoadmap.md)) so it will be growing over time.
