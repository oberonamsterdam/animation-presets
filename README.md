# React animation presets
Welcome to the React animation presets project. This project will give an overview of reusable animations used within react projects.

To see the live animation examples click [here](https://oberonamsterdam.github.io/react-animation-presets/).

## Motivation
The reason this package was created is because there are alot of animations that can be reused. So it would be meaningless to re√Ønvent the wheel everytime we want to create a default page transition or a button hover. This package will help developers to create those kind of animations quicker and easier.

More animations will be added to this package (checkout the [animation roadmap](animationRoadmap.md)) so it will be growing over time.

## Installation
`npm install react-animation-presets` or  `yarn add react-animation-presets`

## Usage
import the animation you want to use from the library, in the example we are using the `ImageLoad` animation.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { ImageLoad } from 'react-animation-presets';

export default App extends React.Component (
    <div className="App">
        <ImageLoad
            alt="Image alt text"
            color="#222"
            ratio={16 / 9}
            src="https://picsum.photos/960/540?random"
            src2x="https://picsum.photos/1920/1080?random"
        />
    </div>
);
```

## Copy and paste
For this package we are using the tool [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook). This means we have a nice overview of all the animations available in this package. When you make a choice on the animation you want to include in your project just head over to the `jsx` tab for the chosen animation and `copy` and `paste` the code and you are set!

## Want to contribute?
So you want to contribute to this library? Yaay! Good for you and for us! We want this library to have a good amount of content so it will be easier and faster to create more immersive content to websites/apps. Check the [animation requirements list](animationRequirementsList.md) to see the minimum requirements for each animation.
